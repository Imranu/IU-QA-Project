Imran Uddin QA Assignment

Why are we doing this?

- We are tasked with creating an api. This project allows us to demonstrate our technical ability and also our project management skills.

How I expected the challenge to go.

- Easy, straightforward...

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

- Documentation was very dry... Coding was super easy.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

- Relational Databases...
